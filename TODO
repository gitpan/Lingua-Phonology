Wishlist from 0.01:

* Have better handling of suprasegmentals, rather than the hackish,
unintuitive way it's done now. Ideally, we should be able to specify which
segment is the head of a suprasegmental group (like a syllable or foot),
and let the suprasegment have properties of its own unrelated to the
segments beneath it.

* Provide a library of functions to be used in rules. These should provide
simple implementations of common linguistic processes, like assimilate(),
dissimilate(), etc. [Implemented in 0.11]

* Someday in the far future, add Optimality Theory to the module.

=============================

Wishlist from 0.11:

* Allow users to define their own codereferences for number_form and text_form
in Features (will require some code revision).

* Improve the Rules module for speed. Avoid the current bad implementation of
deleting and altering segments.

* Improve the Symbols module for speed. [Implemented in 0.2]

* Rewrite the defaults for Features and Symbols so that we don't need the
open_defaults function anymore (why didn't I just do this in the first place?).
[Implemented in 0.2]

* Allow for diacritics in the Symbols module. [Implemented in 0.2]

* Create a shell mode.

* Create a loadfile method for Rules. This will be a major challenge, given the
complexity of a rule.

==============================

Wishlist from 0.2:

* Most of the things from 0.11 are still unimplemented (and perhaps should stay that way?)
