Phonology version 0.11
======================

This module allows for the creation and manipulation of language
phonologies computationally. It consists of a top-level module,
Lingua::Phonology, and several sub-modules.

Documentation for all of these modules can be found on CPAN, or in the
manual pages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This is assuming that you're on an operating system that supports make. If
you're not (as with Windows), you'll be on your own for unzipping the files and
putting them in the correct places. There may be scripts or other utilities for
assisting you with this process.

Regardless of your operating system, you can use the CPAN module to automate
most of these steps.

DEPENDENCIES

Lingua::Phonology::Rules no longer depends on any other modules to run.
However, it does include two recommended modules: Whatif and Graph. Graph is a
standard Perl module and is probably available on your system. Whatif may be
downloaded from CPAN if it isn't already available.

If these modules *are* available, then you will get a few unexpected success
messages when running make test, as if a TODO test had succeeded. These tests
aren't actually TODO, though--they're only marked as such to indicate their
optional nature. 

If these modules aren't available, you don't lose much--just one method from
Lingua::Phonology::Features, and one parameter in Lingua::Phonology::Rules.
