                  Lingua::Phonology

This module allows for the creation and manipulation of language
phonologies computationally. It consists of a top-level module,
Lingua::Phonology, and several sub-modules.

Documentation for all of these modules can be found on CPAN, or in the
manual pages.

Install:

On Unix and its kin, unzip and untar the package. This will create a
temporary directory like 'Lingua-Phonology-0.00', where "0.00" will represent
the current version number. Change to that directory and run:

perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install

That should be all that's needed. Alternately, you can just use the CPAN
perl module, which will do all of this for you.

There's no reason for Lingua::Phonology not to work on other OS's, but
you're on your own for installation if your OS doesn't support make.
