Phonology version 0.3
======================

This module allows for the creation and manipulation of language
phonologies computationally. It consists of a top-level module,
Lingua::Phonology, and several sub-modules.

Documentation for all of these modules can be found on CPAN, or in the
manual pages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This is assuming that you're on an operating system that supports make. If
you're not (as with Windows), you'll be on your own for unzipping the files and
putting them in the correct places. There may be scripts or other utilities for
assisting you with this process.

Regardless of your operating system, you can use the CPAN module to automate
most of these steps.

DEPENDENCIES

XML::Simple v2.08

Parse::RecDescent v1.9

B::Deparse v0.63

Recommended:

Whatif v1.0

Graph v0.2

If the recommended  modules are available, then you will get a few unexpected
success messages when running make test, as if a TODO test had succeeded. These
tests aren't actually TODO, though--they're only marked as such to indicate
their optional nature. 

If these modules aren't available, you don't lose much--just one method from
Lingua::Phonology::Features, and one parameter in Lingua::Phonology::Rules.
