Phonology version 0.11
======================

This module allows for the creation and manipulation of language
phonologies computationally. It consists of a top-level module,
Lingua::Phonology, and several sub-modules.

Documentation for all of these modules can be found on CPAN, or in the
manual pages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

This is assuming that you're on an operating system that supports make. If
you're not (as with Windows), you'll be on your own for unzipping the files and
putting them in the correct places. There may be scripts or other utilities for
assisting you with this process.

Regardless of your operating system, you can use the CPAN module to automate
most of these steps.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	File::Basename
	File::Spec

I'd like to get rid of this dependency at some point in the future, so keep
your eyes out for that. If you don't have these modules and are unwilling or
unable to install them, be aware that Lingua::Phonology is still usable. The
only loss is that the loading of default features will be disabled. You can,
however, simply drag the files 'default.features' and 'default.symbols' from
their homes and put them somewhere convenient for you. You'll find them in the
same directory that Features.pm and Symbols.pm reside in.
